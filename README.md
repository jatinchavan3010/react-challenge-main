# React Challenge

## Instructions

This repository includes a naive implementation of a React application designed to search for, and display, information about countries (using https://restcountries.com/).

Your task is to refactor and improve the application.

Focus on clean, maintainable code and your proficiency with components, state management, and API integration.

Commit your changes as you go & submit your work via a GitHub repository link.

Update this `README` with anything that you'd like to do if you had more time.

### Things to consider

1. Accessibility
2. Robust error handling
3. Testing
4. Responsiveness
5. Ease of updating the data source
6. Appearance: Style is secondary; however, a basic, user-friendly UI is appreciated
7. Anything else: You are welcome to add any features that highlight your capabilities

## Getting Started

### Scripts

1. Install packages

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run locally
