# React Challenge

## Instructions

This repository includes a naive implementation of a React application designed to search for, and display, information about countries (using https://restcountries.com/).

Your task is to refactor and improve the application.

Focus on clean, maintainable code and your proficiency with components, state management, and API integration.

Commit your changes as you go & submit your work via a GitHub repository link.

Update this `README` with anything that you'd like to do if you had more time.

### Things to consider

1. Accessibility
2. Robust error handling
3. Testing
4. Responsiveness
5. Ease of updating the data source
6. Appearance: Style is secondary; however, a basic, user-friendly UI is appreciated
7. Anything else: You are welcome to add any features that highlight your capabilities

### Additional Improvements If I Had More Time

1. Additional Filters and Sorting Options.
2. Error Boundary Component as the application grows for handling render errors gracefully.
3. More test cases particularly with filters and search as the application grows.
4. It would be beneficial to implement pagination when search results become long.
5. Implement caching techniques to optimize and make the app more efficient.
